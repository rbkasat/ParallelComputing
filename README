# PCTSpeedup

A mini project that compares the performance of various parallel computing methods by performing matrix multiplication on large-size matrix by calculating the time taken by each approach. The main goal is to implement varoius techniques to speed up the tasks that require high CPU Usage.

### Features
1. Simple Matrix Multiplication
2. Implicit Parallelism Techniques like loop unrolling
3. Use of pthreads to achieve multithreaded multiplication
4. OpenMP
5. Pthreads to hyperthreads mapping 
6. Compiler flags
7. Strassen algorithm for matrix multiplication

### How to use

The code implements pthreads that are supported by Unix, thus it can be executed on Unix :

* Download the project

 Compile it with make file as: 
```sh
make -f execMake
```
OR

Use compiler flag to get optimized code and save execution time:
```sh
gcc -O3 <sourcefile1> <sourcefile2> ... <sourcefileN> -o sampleTest
```

Now run the code as:
```sh
./sampleTest
```
Provide the desired number of threads to e created as a power of 2 eg: 1,2,4,8 etc.
This is because the Strassen's algorithm requires power of 2 threads.

To avoid the segmentation fault, which occurs due to high size of stack is desired, set the stack size to unlimited using following command:
```sh
ulimit -s unlimited
```
To understand the performance better, change the MATRIX_SIZE in hdr_const.h file to higher number as power of 2 eg: 8192.


### Experimental Result
The configuration of system on which the experiment was carried out:
* Number of CPU cores : 4
* Hyperthreads : Yes

The experiment was carried out for different number of threads on a matrix of size 8192*8192 and it was found that the time taken by matrix multipliaction was least when,
number of threads= number of CPU cores.

Following table depicts the experimental result thus found. 

Time taken by simple matrix multiplication : 12274 sec.

|Number of threads|2|4|8|16|
|------|---|---|---|---|
|Execution time multithreading tech in sec|8270|3190|3224|10256|
|Execution time all techniques in sec |1567|638|674|10250|
